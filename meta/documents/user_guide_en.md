##### Linking the PayPal PLUS Wall:

1. Click on **Start&nbsp;» Plugins**. 
2. Click on the **Content** tab. 
3. Select the area PayPal PLUS Wall.

			<td>Optional: Link the PayPal Express Checkout button where it is needed, e.g. on the item page (Single item) or next to the shopping cart. In clicking this button, the customer can purchase the item or the content of the shopping cart at once, without going through the regular checkout. In this case, the customer will be forwarded to the PayPal payment process. The shipping address is provided by PayPal.</td>

		<tr>

			<b>PayPal Installment Prepare Button</b>

			</td>
			</tr>

After a click on <strong>Apply for installments</strong>, the customer is redirected to PayPal's website to choose between qualifying financing options. After this, the customer is redirected to the shop. The seller has to inform about all details concerning the payment before the customer makes the order. Back in the shop, an overlay opens to display the total of the basket items and the financing costs. This overlay can only be exited by clicking on <strong>Cancel</strong> or <strong>Order now</strong>.<br />Clicking on <strong>Cancel</strong> leads back to the checkout, clicking on <strong>Order now</strong> irrevocably confirms the payment by installments. <br />The Financing Check has to be linked with one of the containers in the checkout, although not as an override, since this could overwrite critical content.<br />
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>
				<b>PayPal Installment Financing Check</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				According to legal requirements, all financing costs have to be displayed at the time of purchase.

In addition, the financing costs are displayed on the customer invoice.
